# Project Purpose
As this census dataset is very big in size and a normal person can't understand what is happening in the dataset. So as a data analyst i tried to answer some of the question by writing some sql queries in my workbench to summarize that data and get useful information from the census data.

Following are the some question I tried to answer:

1. What is total population of India in 2011?

2. What is average population of each state in 2011?

3. List the state that have more population than the averaage population.

4. What is literacy percentage of each state?

5. Top and bottom three states that stands in literacy percentage.

6. Regional diversity percentage of each state.

7. Total number of male and female percentage that live in each state.

8. percentage of male literate in each state

9.percentage of female of literate in each state

10. Check percentage of people available in each state according to age group

11.etc...
